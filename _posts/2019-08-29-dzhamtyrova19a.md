title: Competitive Online Regression under Continuous Ranked Probability Score
abstract: "We consider the framework of competitive prediction\r when one provides
  guarantees compared to other predictive models that are called experts.\r We propose
  the algorithm that combines point predictions of an infinite pool of linear experts\r
  and outputs probability forecasts in the form of cumulative distribution functions.\r
  We evaluate the quality of probabilistic prediction by the continuous ranked probability
  score (CRPS),\r which is a widely used proper scoring rule.\r We provide a strategy
  that allows us to “track the best expert”\r and derive the theoretical bound on
  the discounted loss of the strategy.\r Experimental results on synthetic data and
  solar power data show\r that the theoretical bounds of our algorithm are not violated.\r
  Also the algorithm performs close to and sometimes outperforms the retrospectively
  best quantile regression."
