title: Applying Conformal Prediction to Control an Exoskeleton
abstract: "This paper investigates the use of the Conformal Prediction (CP) framework\r
  for providing confidence measures to assist a Brain Machine Interface (BMI)\r in
  the task of controlling an exoskeleton using electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram
  (EOG) clips.\r Reliable and accurate control of assistive robotics is still an important
  challenge\r because of the noisy nature of EEG’s and EOG’s\r and the fact that any
  misclassification can lead to unwanted actions and serious safety risks.\r Therefore
  a technique that will compliment predictions with a well-calibrated indication of
  how correct they are,\r should be very beneficial for the particular application
  as it can significantly enhance safety.\r Our approach consists of an Inductive
  Conformal Predictor (ICP)\r built on top of a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory
  (BiLSTM) Neural Network.\r We conduct experiments on a dataset consisting of EEG
  and EOG data\r collected from one subject with a high spinal cord lesion."
