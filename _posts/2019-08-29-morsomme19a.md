title: Conformal Prediction for Students’ Grades in a Course Recommender System
abstract: "Course selection can be challenging for students of Liberal Arts programs.\r
  In particular, due to the highly personalized curricula of these students,\r it
  is often difficult to assess whether or not a particular course is too advanced
  given their academic background.\r To assist students of the liberal arts program
  of the University College Maastricht,\r Morsomme and Vazquez (2019) developed a
  course recommender system that suggests courses\r whose content matches the student’s
  academic interests,\r and issues warnings for courses that it deems too advanced.\r
  To issue warnings, the system produces point predictions\r for the grades that a
  student will receive in the courses\r that she/he is considering for the following
  term.\r Point predictions are estimated with regression models specific to each
  course\r which take into account the academic performance of the student\r along
  with the knowledge that she/he has acquired in previous courses.\r A warning is
  issued if the predicted grade is a fail.\r In this paper, we complement the system’s
  point predictions for grades\r with prediction intervals constructed using the conformal
  prediction framework (Vovk et al., 2005).\r We use the Inductive Confidence Machine
  (ICM) (Papadopoulos et al., 2002) with normalized nonconformity scores\r to construct
  prediction intervals that are tailored to each student.\r We find that the prediction
  intervals constructed with the ICM are valid\r and that their widths are related
  to the accuracy of the underlying regression model."
