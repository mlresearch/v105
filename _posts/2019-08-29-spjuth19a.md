title: Combining Prediction Intervals on Multi-Source Non-Disclosed Regression Datasets
abstract: "Conformal Prediction is a framework that produces prediction intervals\r
  based on the output from a machine learning algorithm.\r In this paper we explore
  the case when training data is made up of multiple parts\r available in different
  sources that cannot be pooled.\r We here consider the regression case and propose
  a method\r where a conformal predictor is trained on each data source independently,\r
  and where the prediction intervals are then combined into a single interval.\r We
  call the approach Non-Disclosed Conformal Prediction (NDCP),\r and we evaluate it
  on a regression dataset from the UCI machine learning repository\r using support
  vector regression as the underlying machine learning algorithm,\r with varying number
  of data sources and sizes.\r The results show that the proposed method produces
  conservatively valid prediction intervals,\r and while we cannot retain the same
  efficiency as when all data is used,\r efficiency is improved through the proposed
  approach\r as compared to predicting using a single arbitrarily chosen source."
