title: Conformal predictor combination using Neyman–Pearson Lemma
abstract: "The problem of how to combine advantageously Conformal Predictors (CP)\r
  has attracted the interest of many researchers in recent years.\r The challenge
  is to retain validity, while improving efficiency.\r In this article a very generic
  method is proposed\r which takes advantage of a well-established result in Classical
  Statistical Hypothesis Testing,\r the Neyman–Pearson Lemma, to combine CP with maximum
  efficiency.\r The merits and the limits of the method are explored on synthetic
  data sets\r under different levels of correlation between NonConformity Measures
  (NCM).\r CP Combination via Neyman–Pearson Lemma generally outperforms other combination
  methods\r when an accurate and robust density ratio estimation method,\r such as
  the V-Matrix method, is used."
