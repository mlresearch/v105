title: Test statistics and p-values
abstract: "We point out that the traditional notion of test statistic is too narrow,\r
  even for the purpose of conformal prediction.\r The most natural generalization
  of the traditional notion happens to be too wide.\r We propose another natural generalization
  which is arguably the widest reasonable generalization.\r The study is restricted
  to simple statistical hypotheses."
