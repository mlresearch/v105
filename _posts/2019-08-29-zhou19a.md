title: Ensembles based on conformal instance transfer
abstract: "In this paper we propose a new ensemble method based on conformal instance
  transfer.\r The method combines feature selection and source-instance selection
  to avoid negative transfer in a model-independent way.\r It was tested experimentally
  for different types of classifiers on several benchmark data sets.\r The experiment
  results demonstrate that the new method is capable of outperforming significantly\r
  standard instance transfer methods."
