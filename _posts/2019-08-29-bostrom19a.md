title: Predicting with Confidence from Survival Data
abstract: "Survival modeling concerns predicting\r whether or not an event will occur
  before or on a given point in time.\r In a recent study, the conformal prediction
  framework was applied to this task,\r and so-called conformal random survival forest
  was proposed.\r It was empirically shown that the error level of this model indeed
  is very close\r to the provided confidence level,\r and also that the error for
  predicting each outcome, i.e., event or no-event,\r can be controlled separately
  by employing a Mondrian approach.\r The addressed task concerned making predictions
  for time points as provided by the underlying distribution.\r However, if one instead
  is interested in making predictions with respect to some specific time point,\r
  the guarantee of the conformal prediction framework no longer holds,\r as one is
  effectively considering a sample from another distribution\r than from which the
  calibration instances have been drawn.\r In this study, we propose a modification
  of the approach for specific time points,\r which transforms the problem into a
  binary classification task,\r thereby allowing the error level to be controlled.\r
  The latter is demonstrated by an empirical investigation\r using both a collection
  of publicly available datasets\r and two in-house datasets from a truck manufacturing
  company."
