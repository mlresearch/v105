title: Split knowledge transfer in learning under privileged information framework
abstract: "Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI)\r enables the inclusion of
  additional (privileged) information when training machine learning models,\r data
  that is not available when making predictions.\r The methodology has been successfully
  applied to a diverse set of problems from various fields.\r SVM+ was the first realization
  of the LUPI paradigm which showed fast convergence but did not scale well.\r To
  address the scalability issue, knowledge transfer approaches were proposed\r to
  estimate privileged information from standard features in order to construct improved
  decision rules.\r Most available knowledge transfer methods use regression techniques\r
  and the same data for approximating the privileged features as for learning the
  transfer function.\r Inspired by the cross-validation approach,\r we propose to
  partition the training data into $K$ folds and use each fold for learning a transfer
  function\r and the remaining folds for approximations of privileged features—we
  refer to this as split knowledge transfer.\r We evaluate the method using four different
  experimental setups comprising one synthetic and three real datasets.\r The results
  indicate that our approach leads to improved accuracy\r as compared to LUPI with
  standard knowledge transfer."
