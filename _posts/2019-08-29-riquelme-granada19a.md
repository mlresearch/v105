title: Coreset-based Conformal Prediction for Large-scale Learning
abstract: "As the volume of data increase rapidly,\r most traditional machine learning
  algorithms become computationally prohibitive.\r Furthermore, the available data
  can be so big that a single machine’s memory can easily be overflown.\r We propose
  Coreset-Based Conformal Prediction,\r a strategy for dealing with big data by applying
  conformal predictors\r to a weighted summary of data—namely the coreset.\r We compare
  our approach against standalone inductive conformal predictors\r over three large
  competition-grade datasets\r to demonstrate that our coreset-based strategy may
  not only significantly improve the learning speed,\r but also retains predictions
  validity and the predictors’ efficiency."
