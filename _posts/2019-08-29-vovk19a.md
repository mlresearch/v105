title: Universally Consistent Conformal Predictive Distributions
abstract: "This paper describes conformal predictive systems that are universally
  consistent\r in the sense of being consistent under any data-generating distribution,\r
  assuming that the observations are produced independently in the IID fashion.\r
  Being conformal, these predictive systems satisfy a natural property of small-sample
  validity,\r namely they are automatically calibrated in probability."
