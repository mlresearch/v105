title: A Deep Neural Network Conformal Predictor for Multi-label Text Classification
abstract: "We investigate the use of inductive conformal prediction (ICP)\r for the
  task of multi-label text classification\r and present preliminary experimental results
  for a subset of the original Reuters-21578 data-set.\r Our underlying classification
  model is a deep neural network configuration\r which consists of a trainable embedding
  layer, a convolutional layer and two dense feed-forward layers,\r arranged sequentially,\r
  with sigmoid outputs representing the individual unique labels of the selected subset.\r
  Following the power-set approach,\r we assign nonconformity scores to label-sets\r
  from which the corresponding p-values and prediction-sets are determined\r and we
  experiment with a number of different versions of a nonconformity measure.\r Our
  results indicate a good performance for the underlying model\r which is carried
  on to the ICP without any significant accuracy loss\r and with the added benefits
  of prediction-specific confidence information.\r Prediction-sets are tight enough
  to be practically useful\r even though the multi-label subset contains tens of thousands
  of possible label combinations\r and empirical error-rates confirm that our outputs
  are well-calibrated."
