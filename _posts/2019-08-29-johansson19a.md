title: Interpretable and specialized conformal predictors
abstract: "In real-world scenarios, interpretable models are often required to explain
  predictions,\r and to allow for inspection and analysis of the model.\r The overall
  purpose of oracle coaching is to produce highly accurate, but interpretable, models\r
  optimized for a specific test set.\r Oracle coaching is applicable to the very common
  scenario\r where explanations and insights are needed for a specific batch of predictions,\r
  and the input vectors for this test set are available when building the predictive
  model.\r In this paper, oracle coaching is used for generating underlying classifiers
  for conformal prediction.\r The resulting conformal classifiers output valid label
  sets,\r i.e., the error rate on the test data is bounded by a preset significance
  level,\r as long as the labeled data used for calibration is exchangeable with the
  test set.\r Since validity is guaranteed for all conformal predictors, the key performance
  metric is efficiency,\r i.e., the size of the label sets, where smaller sets are
  more informative.\r The main contribution of this paper is the design of setups\r
  making sure that when oracle-coached decision trees,\r that per definition utilize
  knowledge about test data,\r are used as underlying models for conformal classifiers,\r
  the exchangeability between calibration and test data is maintained.\r Consequently,
  the resulting conformal classifiers retain the validity guarantees.\r In the experimentation,
  using a large number of publicly available data sets,\r the validity of the suggested
  setups is empirically demonstrated.\r Furthermore, the results show that the more
  accurate underlying models produced by oracle coaching\r also improved the efficiency
  of the corresponding conformal classifiers."
