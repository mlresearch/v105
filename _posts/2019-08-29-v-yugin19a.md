title: Online Learning with Continuous Ranked Probability Score
abstract: "Probabilistic forecasts in the form of probability distributions over future
  events\r have become popular in several fields of statistical science.\r The dissimilarity
  between a probability forecast and an outcome is measured by a loss function (scoring
  rule).\r Popular example of scoring rule for continuous outcomes is the continuous
  ranked probability score (CRPS).\r We consider the case where several competing
  methods produce online predictions\r in the form of probability distribution functions.\r
  In this paper, the problem of combining probabilistic forecasts\r is considered
  in the prediction with expert advice framework.\r We show that CRPS is a mixable
  loss function\r and then the time-independent upper bound for the regret of the
  Vovk’s Aggregating Algorithm\r using CRPS as a loss function can be obtained.\r
  We present the results of numerical experiments illustrating the proposed methods."
